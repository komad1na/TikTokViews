## :hammer_and_wrench: How to make it work

Go to **tiktokviews.js** file copy whole content 

Then open Bookmarks in your browser create new bookmark, name it whatever you want and paste everything you copied into **URL** textbox
 
After that save it

Go to any profile on tiktok **scroll down to load all videos** (MANDATORY) from profile and execute bookmark 

After execution you will see **APPROXIMATION** of all views profile has on all videos next to the **Likes** and **Followers** count

## :warning: DISCLAIMER :warning:

Script is only **approximately** calculates how many views your videos have. 

Example: If you have 1.2M views on one video it will be 1,200,000 and anything in between will be discarded since values are not visible. 
So your video can have 1,289,000 but 89,000 will not be calculated, it will be added once you reach 1,300,000 views
